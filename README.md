Code Review 2



Good Morning Students! 

Welcome to your 2nd CodeReview!  After learning CSS3, it is time to create your second CodeReview and mobile-friendly website! 

You will need to achieve more than 60 points to pass this CodeReview successfully.  

You will be graded accordingly to the results achieved. Please see the number of points for each task below.  

The grading system has the following rules: 

Up to 60 points = red 

Between 61 and 79 = yellow 

Over 80 = green 

You can submit your solution (as GitHub project link) until Saturday 18:00:00. 

 

 

Project description: 

You will create a new mobile-friendly website for one of the most popular food blogs out there, fittingly named “Food blog” . 

Please examine the image below and use it as a guide in order to create your index.html for the desktop resolutions: 

 

 

 

For this CodeReview, the following criteria will be graded: 

(5 points) Create a GitHub Repository named: FE16-CR2-YourName. Push the files into it and send the link through the learning management system (lms). See an example of a GitHub link below: 

https://github.com/JohnDoe/repositoryname.git 

Please remember to set your repository to private and invite codefactorygit as a collaborator! 

 

(10 points) Correct usage of the HTML structure (proper order of HTML elements and code indentation) 

(10 points) Use CSS selectors (classes and/or IDs) to style your web page (colours, font size, font style etc.). 

(05 points) Correct usage of lists to show the menu (navigation bar) 

(15 points) Correct usage of Flexbox or FlexGrid. The elements should be displayed accordingly to the image guide (image on the left with 3 columns), next to each other, respecting the columns and rows. 

(20 points) Correct placement of images with their respective titles. The elements should be displayed accordingly to the image guide for the desktop (please note that the title element has an opacity overlay).  

(20 points) Correct usage of Media Queries. For mobile, for the resolution of =< 480px, you should use the second guide template (image on the right with 1 column). 

(10 points) Create a "recipe of the month" page and include the link in the navbar. Fill this page with individual content. Be creative and choose a delicious recipe. 

(05 points) The contact-link must be linked to the https://codefactory.wien/en/contact-en/ URL.

Bonus Points: 

(05 points) Use SASS/SCSS tools to style your site.

(05 points) Add links to the navbar that lead to other local HTML pages that you will additionally create for these bonus points and you are free to provide your design/layout solutions for these additional pages. About, Contact Us, etc.  

(10 points) Create a Media Query for tablets. For this option, as the tablet resolution is wider, two columns should be able to fit in the screen. *Research what is the most popular tablet breaking point.

NOTE: Bootstrap won't be accepted in this code review. It is important to follow the structure of the layout, including the placement of all elements. The cropping of the images, the font size and font family are not important. 

You can use sources such as https://unsplash.com, https://pixabay.com to find the best pictures for this CodeReview.
Focus on how the recipes are positioned in the 2 images:  3 columns layout for the desktop vs. 1 column layout in the mobile version.

Hey Sanja,

really well done in this CR, you managed to get most of the normal points and all the bonus points. I especially liked that you added hover effects everywhere, very nice! Although with a slower transition would be better. You also took advantage of SCSS and you have some imports, nesting, etc. And you also kept the style in the extra pages, but you could work a bit in the about page, the style is not great.

The only thing that you missed was to use lists in the navbar, it was a requirement. Although nice solution anyway.

As some feedback, I'd say that the navbar looks a little compressed in the phone version, you could work on it to make it look nicer. Also, the navbar links are broken, if you don't have any extra pages for them, just refer them to the index page. :)

There is no much more I can say.

Other than that, amazing job!
Keep it up!
