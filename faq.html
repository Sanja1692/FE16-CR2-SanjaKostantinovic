            <h4 class="font-h4">Question: I commented on one of your recipes and am wondering why it hasn't been posted.



            </h4>
            <p>Answer: I make it a point to read every comment left on our blog and do my best to respond in a timely manner, especially to any questions. I love engaging with readers and only approve comments that add value to the recipe page. All comments
                are filtered for spam and I don't post anything derogatory or rude. I also do not post comments with links in them.</p>
            <h4 class="font-h4">Question: Do you allow guest posts?



            </h4>
            <p>Answer: I currently do not accept guest posts on HowToCook.recipes. I do not see this changing soon, but if the policy changes it will be updated here.</p>
            <h4 class="font-h4">Question: Do you promote brands you like or allow sponsored posts?



            </h4>
            <p>Answer: Yes, I absolutely do! I am always on the lookout for fabulous new products and ideas to share with our HowToCook.recipes readers. I welcome suggestions but will only consider those I think would be a good fit for our audience. In addition,
                we donâ€™t provide reviews of the products.</p>
